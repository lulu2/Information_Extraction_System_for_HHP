How to use OLLIE and put result into EventEditor:

1. In terminal, cd to workspace, which should contain at least 4 files: ollie-app-latest.jar, engmalt.linear-1.7.mco, loadOutput.py, preprocess.py. A makefile may also be contained.

2. Put document into the wordspace. (For instance, the document is record.txt).

3. There are two methods to perform extraction:

  3.1:
	In terminal, run
		make input=[name of input file] output=[name of output file]
	For example, if the input documtn is john.txt, and the file to be loaded to EventEditor is johnExtractions.txt, then it should be
		make input=john.txt output=johnExtractions.txt
	If simply run like
		make
	the input file name should be record.txt which is default in makefile. The default output file is thereItIs.txt.
	Notice that the output file must be a .txt file so that the EventEditor could read. In the end run
		make clean
	to delete the temporary files.

  3.2:
  	In terminal, run
  		python preprocess.py [name of input file] filtered.txt
  	then, run
  		java -Xmx512m -jar ollie-app-latest.jar filtered.txt --split > output.txt
  	finally, run
  		python loadOutput.py output.txt [name of output file]
  	manually delete temporary files.

4. In EventEditor load the output file.
